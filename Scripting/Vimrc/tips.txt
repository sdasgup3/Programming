On windows
===========
Even when installing from "Vim without Cream", the normal place for a
vimrc is what Vim regards as $HOME, and that is normally not under
"Program Files" but under that particular user's personal directory -- see

        :echo $HOME

when running Vim.

However, if Vim finds no $HOME/_vimrc and no $HOME/.vimrc, on Windows it
will also look for $VIM/_vimrc, and that indeed ussssssually  means
C:\Program Files\Vim\_vimrc. If that's where your _vimrc is now, try the
following:

        :view $VIM/_vimrc
        :saveas $HOME/_vimrc

The file should not be readonly anymore, and you ought to be able to
edit it normally using Vim, or any other editor for that matter. Also, a
_vimrc in $HOME will be preferred to one in $VIM so you don't need to
delete that other version (which would require administrator's
privileges, and on Vista, IIUC, even an administrator's account does
_not_ have those privileges until or unless you explicitly ask for
them), unless that $VIM/_vimrc shouldn't be available to all users.

Note that regardless of whether or not a $HOME/_vimrc is present, Vim
looks first for a $VIM/vimrc (with no underscxore or dot prepended) and
sources it if found. (This is called a "system vimrc".) Only then does
it look for $HOME/_vimrc, sources it if found, and looks for it at other
places if not found.
