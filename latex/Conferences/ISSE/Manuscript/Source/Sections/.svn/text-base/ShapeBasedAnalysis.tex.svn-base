In  context insensitive analysis  we compromise  on accuracy,
whereas  in  context  sensitive  analysis, we  compromise  on
memory   consumption.  To   compromise  between   the  memory
consumption and  precision, we propose  a shape-based context
sensitive  analysis which  is  midway between  the above  two
approaches.

It  is evident  that  merging all  possible calling  contexts
during function call  leads to conservative incoming data-flow
values  which  results  in  inferring  imprecise  shapes.  In
shape-based context sensitive approach,   we  keep  separate  
set  of data-flow  values for  each  possible shape  at   the 
start  of functions and the merging of calling contexts    is 
based on the shape of the   heap    pointer  arguments during 
function call.

We  expect that  this methods  helps in  reducing  the memory
consumption as compared to context sensitive analysis without
loosing much  on precision. However,  we are yet  to complete
the   implementation  of  this   approach  and   evaluate  it
experimentally.
