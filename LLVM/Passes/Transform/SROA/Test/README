Some allocaes are generated during expansion adnremain unused. 
Also the original struct alloca is present without any use

struct contain an array which is used as is.
struct becomes non expandable

the atruct contaibn an array used as bit elemnet, and hence expanded, but the expanded array cannot be promoted
xT_10_2.c xT_9_2


the atruct contaibn an array NOT used , and hence it is NOT expanded, but that may lead to some " non strcut " allocas to be non promoted 
as the code will not do the promotion if nothing is there to expand
xT_10_3.c

stu_data_ptr = &stu_data; is illegal
xT_9_1.c

/-scalarrepl can handle bicast as a use of gept, but not mine

scanf(&n) cannot be promotable
strcut arrays are not expanded
