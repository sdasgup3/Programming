\chapter{Future Work}
We discussed various aspects for the parallel processing and high performance computing in the report. The future work will involve the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A detailed survey of computer architecture, specifically for pipelined processors,is to be done.
\item Since optimisation of the code is of utmost importance, so the in-depth knowledge is to be gained in the field of compiler theory.
\item Message passing strategies need to be explored in a greater detail.
\item Linear Algebra algorithms for the uniprocessor computation and its extensions for the multiprocessor paradigm are to be devised.
\item There is a need for the general algorithms to be made compatible to the multiprocessor systems. 
\item Algorithms have to be discovered or divised, which are best suitable for shared memory systems.
\end{enumerate}
