- NASM, the Netwide Assembler, uses the Intel syntax just like TASM, MASM, and other DOS assemblers,
and the structure is also fairly similar
- as and gas use the AT&T syntax, which is somewhat different: eg. all registers must be prefixed with a %,
and the source operand comes before the destination.
