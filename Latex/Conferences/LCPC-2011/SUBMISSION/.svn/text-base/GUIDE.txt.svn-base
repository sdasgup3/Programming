General
=========
The numbers accorded to lemmas, proposi-tions, and theorems, etc. should appear in consecutive order, starting with Lemma 1. Please do not include 
section counters in the numbering like “Theorem 1.1”.
3rd-level heading: Run-in Heading in Bold.

There is no need to include page numbers or running heads; this will be done at our end. If your paper title is too long to serve as a running head, 
it will be shortened. Your suggestion as to how to shorten it would be most welcome.

Figures
==========
Figure environments should be inserted after (not in) the paragraph in which
the figure is first mentioned.

The lettering in figures should not use font sizes smaller than 6 pt (~ 2mm character height). 

Figures are to be numbered and to have a caption which should always be positioned under the figures, in contrast to the 
caption belonging to a table, which should always appear above the table.

Please center the figures or your tabular material by using the \centering
declaration.

Short captions are centered by default between the margins and
typeset in 9-point type  
Longer captions, covering more than one line, are justified (Fig. 1and Fig. 2 show examples). 
Captions that do not constitute a full sentence, do not have a period. 
Text fragments of fewer than four lines should not appear at the tops or bottoms of pages, following a table or figure. 
In such cases, it is better to set the figures right at the top or right at the bottom of the page. 

A figure should never be placed in the mid-dle of a paragraph.

Formulas
============
Equations should be punctuated in the same way as ordinary text but with a small space before the end punctuation mark.

Program
==========
Program listings or program commands in the text are normally set in typewriter font e.g., CMTT10 or Courier.

LNCS
-----
If you wish to start a new paragraph immediately after a displayed equation,
insert a blank line so as to produce the required indentation. If there is no
new paragraph either do not insert a blank line or code \noindent immediately
before continuing the text.

Please punctuate a displayed equation in the same way as other ordinary
text but with an \enspace before end punctuation.
