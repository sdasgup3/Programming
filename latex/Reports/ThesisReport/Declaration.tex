I declare that this written submission represents my ideas in my own 
words except Appendix A and B whose contents are borrowed from Ghiya et. al.~\cite{Ghiya96} and Marron et. al.~\cite{marron06static} respectively for the 
ease of reference. The places where others' ideas or words have been included, I have adequately cited and 
referenced the original sources.
