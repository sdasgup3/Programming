#Lazy Set
#VARIABLE = value
#Normal setting of a variable - values within it are recursively expanded when the variable is used, not when it's declared	  
#  
#Immediate Set
#VARIABLE := value
#Setting of a variable with simple expansion of the values inside - values within it are expanded at declaration time.

#Set If Absent
#VARIABLE ?= value
#Setting of a variable only if it doesn't have a value
#
#Append
#VARIABLE += value
#Appending the supplied value to the existing value (or setting to that value if the variable didn't exist)
