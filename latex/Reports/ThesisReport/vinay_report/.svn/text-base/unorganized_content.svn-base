Memory fault handling---

The equatuons generated can be very very large,for a simple program such as this testycase it can be 2gb
By use of pointers to previous equations and maintaining versions of boolean equations at each statement...    (2gb--64mb) {Not sure of the numbers}

Reducing the time:

Initially 4hours for merge_iter_create_fixed.cpp
Step1)Started storing the postfix instead of the infix --reduced to 2 hours
step2)Started keeping the stored result with us----reduced to 9 seconds.
